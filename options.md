# Sprint Options

Here are some example mini app ideas for you to choose from for this sprint:

## Multiple Choice Quiz

- Create a quiz that asks a series of questions to the user.
- Each question should have multiple choice answers the user can click on.
- The user should receive feedback, telling them if they answered correctly.
- Answering a question should move the user on to the next question after feedback.
- At the end of the quiz, they should be given their score.

_Additional_

- Randomise the questions to keep your quiz interesting. Make sure you don't repeat any questions!
- Choose a theme for your quiz to make it more interactive. You could pick your favourite game show, or any other theme of your choice, but keep it simple!

## Noughts and Crosses

- Users can click on squares to place an alternating `X`, or `O`, marker.
- If a user places three of their markers either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, then the game lets them know that they've won!

_Additional_

- Players can only choose squares that haven't already been taken.
- Once a player has won, allow them to reset the game.
- Keep track of the players' scores.
- Alternate who goes first.

## Memory Matching Game

Here is an example of a [Memory Matching Game](https://www.memozor.com/memory-games/for-kids/pokemon-game).

- The game starts out with a series of paired images that are hidden from the user.
- The first two images the user clicks on are revealed.
- If the revealed images match, they remain uncovered.
- If the images do not match, they are hidden once again.
- The user continues until they have matched all the images.

_Additional_

- Keep track of how many guesses it took the user to complete the game.
- Randomise the starting position of the images to stop people cheating.

## Simon Game

Here is an example of a [Simon Game](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)>).

- When the user starts the game, a series of colours / images / sounds are shown to the user.
- The user must then recreate the series in the correct order.
- If they get it right, the series gains an extra step and is repeated.
- If the user guesses any part of the series incorrectly, the game is over and they gain points for how many they managed to remember correctly.

_Additional_

- Keep a high score for the current user to beat.
- Add a delay between each part of your sequence using timeouts.

## Which <insert_pop_culture_reference_here> are you?

- Ask the user a series of multiple choice questions in turn.
- When the user answers a question, move on to the next one.
- After all of the questions have been answered, use their answers to match them to a particular choice. Think carefully about how you will weigh up their answers to make a final match.

_Additional_

- Randomise the questions to keep your quiz interesting. Make sure you don't repeat any questions!
